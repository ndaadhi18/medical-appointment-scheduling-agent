## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google API key for Gemini
- Calendly API Key
- SendGrid API Key
- Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and Phone Number
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ndaadhi18/medical-appointment-scheduling-agent
    cd medical-appointment-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up secrets for Streamlit**
    Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in your project's root directory (if it doesn't exist) and add your API keys:
    ```toml
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
    CALENDLY_API_KEY="your_calendly_api_key_here"
    SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_sendgrid_api_key_here"
    SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="your_sendgrid_from_email_here"
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid_here"
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token_here"
    TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="your_twilio_phone_number_here"
    ```
    **Note**: For local development, Streamlit reads secrets from this file. When deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud, you will need to add these secrets directly in the app's settings on the Streamlit Cloud platform.

4.  **Run the Streamlit application**
    ```bash
    streamlit run src/ui_app.py
    ```

5.  **Access the application**
    - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`
